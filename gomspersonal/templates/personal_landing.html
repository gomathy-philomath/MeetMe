      <h1>The Person Behind the Lens</h1>
      <p>
        I’m someone who finds peace in nature — especially on trails near water. Walking outdoors is my reset button, and capturing those quiet moments through nature photography is one of my greatest joys. I love noticing the small things: reflections on a lake, early spring colors, the glow of sunset, or a path that feels like it’s leading somewhere calm.
      </p>
      <p>
        I enjoy experiences that help me unwind and feel present, whether it’s a relaxing day with my family, exploring places like Cosm or the Gaylord Texan water park, or simply getting lost in a beautiful view. Nature gives me space to breathe, think, and feel grounded.
      </p>
      <p>
        My philosophy is simple:
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Sometimes you win, sometimes you learn.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        I try to embrace each moment — good or challenging — as part of the journey.
      </p>
      <p>
        This space is where I share the things that bring me joy, peace, and inspiration.
      </p>
      <p>
        Books are a quiet escape for me — a way to slow down, reflect, and learn something new. I read the same way I walk through nature: with curiosity and intention. I’m drawn to books that teach, inspire, or open my mind to a different perspective. Sometimes it’s a deep, thoughtful read; other times it’s something light that simply brings joy.
